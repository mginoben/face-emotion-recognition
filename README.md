# Face Emotion Recognition

In this study, we proposed a CNN-based model to classify four emotions â€“ _angry_, _happy_, _sad_, _surprise_ with an
additional _neutral_ class. The model was trained on 100x100 pixel face images with an applied
_Sobel_ filter for edge detection. The proposed CNN model resulted in 77.3% accuracy
outperforming the benchmark model with 70.1% accuracy. In addition, the model performed
better in classifying _angry_, _happy_, _sad_, and _surprise_ emotions.
